			<p>Here is my repository where I store all my machine learning projects. Currently, I have a project where I made a custom neural network without TensorFlow or Keras, only using NumPy and Pandas, to recognize digits using the MNIST dataset.</p>

			<p>At BrainGames, a mobile game company backed by Bessemer with +$3.6m in yearly revenue and 30K daily users at the time, I wrote a highly-efficient algorithm for generating crosswords to replace the industry veteran's version and increase speed by 500%. I deployed a multicore processing server on Google Cloud to further speed up production by 1600%. I also constructed a web-scraper using Python for gathering lists of words to create crosswords, created a server to receive images and upload them to Google Cloud using JavaScript, implemented Firebase to retrieve player data in a Tornado server, and designed and built a website using Bootstrap to show Firebase data using JavaScript and HTML5. I added BigQuery request capability and added Google OAuth on a Tornado server. I also utilized YouTube and Google Sheets API for ad campaigns.</p>
